<blockquote><p><strong>PI_Team</strong> <code>(Sun 21 Jan 2024 12:25)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 6</em></p><p>correct:

1. You need to create a compute instance to access the shared file system of the workspace.
2. You need to run the ssh-keygen command to generate a new SSH key pair. The public key will be used to authenticate your Git account with SSH, and the private key will be used to access your Git repositories.
3. You need to copy the public key to GitHub. The public key will be used by GitHub to authenticate your SSH connection.
4. You can then run the git clone command to clone the private Git repository to the shared file system of the workspace</p></blockquote>
