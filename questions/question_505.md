D. Serverless compute is the best Azure Machine Learning compute target for Automated ML training jobs that require a multi-node cluster with automatic scaling. It abstracts infrastructure management, automatically scales compute resources up or down based on the job demand, and supports the requirements of large-scale Automated ML training.</p></blockquote>
