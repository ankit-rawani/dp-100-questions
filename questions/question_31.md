<blockquote><p><strong>David_Tadeu</strong> <code>(Fri 15 Apr 2022 10:25)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 3</em></p><p>Linear regression minimizes the sum of squares, i.e. it minimizes S=Sum[(y_i-f_i)^2,{i,1,n}], where y_i is the actual value and f_i the predicted value (we can see it as the average). 

Since the variance of {y_i} is S/n, minimizing S is equivalent to minimizing the variance.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>jed_elhak</strong> <code>(Mon 13 Sep 2021 22:42)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 16</em></p><p>Correct answer is C :
 It builds each regression tree in a step-wise fashion, using a predefined loss function to measure the error in each step and correct for it in the next. Thus the prediction model is actually an ensemble of weaker prediction models.

<blockquote><p><strong>sar77</strong> <code>(Sat 12 Jul 2025 01:27)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>Boosted Decision Tree Regression, including Azure MLâ€™s Boosted Decision Tree (based on LightGBM/MART), is designed to minimize errors between actual and predicted values by sequentially fitting trees that correct previous residuals. This iterative boosting process both reduces bias and lowers variance, resulting in more accurate predictions .</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>brzhanyu</strong> <code>(Sun 13 Oct 2024 02:56)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>The correct answer is Boosted Decision Tree Regression.

Boosted Decision Tree Regression is an algorithm that reduces the variance between actual and predicted values by iteratively combining multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a stronger, more accurate model. This helps minimize the differences between the predicted values and the actual values by focusing on the errors made by previous models.

Linear regression, while useful for linear relationships, does not specifically focus on reducing variance in the way ensemble methods like boosting do.</p></blockquote>

The answer is linear regression, since Poisson regression is actually a form of generalized linear modeling and is often considered a non-linear regression model due to its underlying mathematical structure. Also Boosted decision tree, in a non linear regression as well.</p></blockquote>

Linear regression aims to find the best linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, while Fast Forest Quantile Regression is a regression algorithm that can provide estimates of conditional quantiles of the response variable. Poisson Regression is used when the dependent variable is a count or frequency, and the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is modelled using a Poisson distribution.</p></blockquote>
