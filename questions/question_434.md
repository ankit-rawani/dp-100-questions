# Question 434

DRAG DROP

-

You create a multi-class image classification deep learning model.

The model must be retrained monthly with the new image data fetched from a public web portal. You create an Azure Machine Learning pipeline to fetch new data, standardize the size of images, and retrain the model.

You need to use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 to configure the schedule for the pipeline. The schedule should be defined by using the frequency and interval properties, with frequency set to â€œmonth" and interval set to "1".

Which three classes should you instantiate in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

When you have a pipeline job with satisfying performance and outputs, you can set up a schedule to automatically trigger this job on a regular basis...</p></blockquote>

B - This is a wired answer, it is a pipeline trigger, but doesn&#x27;t have &quot;frequency and interval&quot; parameters, it uses Cron expression. I will take this one only coz question says 3 answers.
E
I didn&#x27;t find any docs showing Pipeline is available as a trigger.
