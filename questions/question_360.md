# Question 360

You have an Azure Machine Learning workspace named WS1.

You plan to use Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 to register a model as an asset in WS1 from an artifact generated by an MLflow run. The artifact resides in a named output of a job used for the model training.

You need to identify the syntax of the path to reference the model when you register it.

Which syntax should you use?

* A.t//model/
* B.azureml://registries
* C.mlflow-model/
* D.azureml://jobs/

<blockquote><p><strong>evangelist</strong> <code>(Sun 23 Jun 2024 06:31)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>The correct syntax to reference the model when registering it from an MLflow run artifact in Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 is:
D. azureml://jobs/
Here&#x27;s why:

In Azure Machine Learning SDK v2, when you want to register a model from a job output, you use the &quot;azureml://&quot; URI scheme.
The &quot;jobs/&quot; part indicates that you&#x27;re referring to a job output.
The full path would typically look something like this:
azureml://jobs/&lt;job-name&gt;/outputs/&lt;output-name&gt;/artifacts/&lt;artifact-path&gt;</p></blockquote>
