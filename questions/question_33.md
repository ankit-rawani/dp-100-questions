<p>The evaluation metrics available for binary classification models are: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC.</p>
<p>Note: A very natural question is: &#x27;Out of the individuals whom the model, how many were classified correctly (TP)?&#x27;</p>
<p>This question can be answered by looking at the Precision of the model, which is the proportion of positives that are classified correctly.</p>
