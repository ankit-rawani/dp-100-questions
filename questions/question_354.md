Chatgpt -When setting up automated machine learning training for an image classification model in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, the primary metric you should choose for optimizing model training is accuracy for binary and multi-class classification models and IoU (Intersection over Union) for multilabel classification models1. These metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of your trained models and ensuring their effectiveness in classifying images accurately.</p></blockquote>
