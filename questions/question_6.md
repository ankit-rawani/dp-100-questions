<blockquote><p><strong>Pradiksha</strong> <code>(Thu 14 Nov 2024 04:22)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>The task is to do language recognition which is an NLP task and as given we need to accomadate python.
1. Rattle is a free, open-source graphical user interface (GUI) for the R software that helps beginners learn data mining, machine learning, and predictive analytics. not for python.
2. Though Theano is a foundation for early deep learning research, it lacks active support and new features. so It&#x27;s not suitable for modern NLP tasks.
3.  Chainer, while capable, has less support and community resources compared to TensorFlow and is no longer actively developed, making it less suitable for current and future NLP tasks.
4. So for a language recognition task on the DSVM, TensorFlow is more suitable than others</p></blockquote>

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for data flow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It was developed by the Google Brain team and is used for building and training machine learning models, particularly neural networks. TensorFlow provides a flexible and efficient platform for implementing machine learning algorithms, and supports a variety of programming languages including Python, C++, and Java. The library provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionality, including visualization and debugging tools, and it has a strong community of developers and users contributing to its ongoing development. TensorFlow is widely used in both academia and industry for various applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.</p></blockquote>
