Bug Resolution (Regression Task):

Metric: R2 Score
Explanation: R2 Score is a suitable metric for regression tasks like bug resolution, as it measures how well the model predicts the variance in the dependent variable. Higher R2 values indicate better model performance in predicting bug resolution times.
Sentiment Analysis (Classification Task):

Metric: Accuracy
Explanation: Accuracy is commonly used for classification tasks like sentiment analysis. It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances. In sentiment analysis, the goal is typically to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Accuracy is a suitable metric for this purpose.</p></blockquote>
