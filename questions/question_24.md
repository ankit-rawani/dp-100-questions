# Question 24

This question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the recommendation satisfies the requirements.

You have been tasked with evaluating your model on a partial data sample via k-fold cross-validation.

You have already configured a k parameter as the number of splits. You now have to configure the k parameter for the cross-validation with the usual value choice.

Recommendation: You configure the use of the value k=1.

Will the requirements be satisfied?

* A.Yes

<blockquote><p><strong>evangelist</strong> <code>(Wed 21 Aug 2024 11:40)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>The usual value choice for k in k-fold cross-validation typically ranges from 5 to 10, with k=10 being a common default. These values are chosen because they provide a good balance between training on enough data points and having a sufficient number of iterations to get a reliable estimate of the model&#x27;s performance.</p></blockquote>
