<blockquote><p><strong>evangelist</strong> <code>(Mon 18 Nov 2024 07:16)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>These metrics are not suitable for evaluating a linear regression model because they are designed for classification tasks, not for predicting continuous numerical values.

For a linear regression model, the appropriate metrics would be:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Relative Absolute Error (RAE)
Relative Squared Error (RSE)
Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)</p></blockquote>
