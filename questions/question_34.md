# Question 34

This question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the recommendation satisfies the requirements.

You have been tasked with constructing a machine learning model that translates language text into a different language text.

The machine learning model must be constructed and trained to learn the sequence of the.

Recommendation: You make use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Will the requirements be satisfied?

* A.Yes
* B.No

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for training text (words sequence) in term of seq2seq, but now it is out of date, use Transformer as alternative solution.

Anyway, GAN is incorrect for NLP (translation).

<blockquote><p><strong>meysa</strong> <code>(Wed 11 Jan 2023 01:05)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 4</em></p><p>No, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.</p></blockquote>
