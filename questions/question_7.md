# Question 7

This question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the recommendation satisfies the requirements.

You have been tasked with employing a machine learning model, which makes use of a PostgreSQL database and needs GPU processing, to forecast prices.

You are preparing to create a virtual machine that has the necessary tools built into it.

You need to make use of the correct virtual machine type.

Recommendation: You make use of a Geo AI Data Science Virtual Machine (Geo-DSVM) Windows edition.

Will the requirements be satisfied?

- A.Yes
- B.No

<blockquote><p><strong>PopeyeDS</strong> <code>(Sun 14 Jan 2024 08:21)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>A more appropriate recommendation would be to use a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) with GPU support. This would ensure that the virtual machine has the necessary tools for machine learning, including PostgreSQL for database management, and also provides GPU capabilities for accelerated processing required by the model.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>aaodiall1</strong> <code>(Fri 01 Dec 2023 16:17)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>Correct answer. no PostgreSQL on the window edition</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>orionduo</strong> <code>(Tue 15 Aug 2023 07:14)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>No is right</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>emmanuelodenyire</strong> <code>(Mon 31 Jul 2023 06:37)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>B. No.

While a Geo AI Data Science Virtual Machine (Geo-DSVM) Windows edition might be a good choice for geographic data processing and analysis, it does not necessarily meet the requirement for GPU processing for the machine learning model and a PostgreSQL database. A different virtual machine type with GPU support and PostgreSQL capabilities might be a better choice for this specific use case. It&#x27;s recommended to check the specific virtual machine offerings and their specifications to ensure that the necessary hardware and software resources are available for the task at hand.</p></blockquote>
