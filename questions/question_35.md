# Question 35

This question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the recommendation satisfies the requirements.

You have been tasked with constructing a machine learning model that translates language text into a different language text.

The machine learning model must be constructed and trained to learn the sequence of the.

Recommendation: You make use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Will the requirements be satisfied?

- A.Yes
- B.No

<strong>A</strong><br>

<p>Note: RNNs are designed to take sequences of text as inputs or return sequences of text as outputs, or both. They&#x27;re called recurrent because the network&#x27;s hidden layers have a loop in which the output and cell state from each time step become inputs at the next time step. This recurrence serves as a form of memory.</p>
<p>It allows contextual information to flow through the network so that relevant outputs from previous time steps can be applied to network operations at the current time step.</p>

Recurrent neural network (RNN)
Recurrent neural networks are a widely used artificial neural network. These networks save the output of a layer and feed it back to the input layer to help predict the layer&#x27;s outcome. Recurrent neural networks have great learning abilities. They&#x27;re widely used for complex tasks such as time series forecasting, learning handwriting, and recognizing language.</p></blockquote>
