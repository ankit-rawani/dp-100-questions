The Model Interpretability component helps you understand how your model makes predictions by providing insights into feature importance, both at an aggregate and individual level. This can help you identify which features are most influential in your model&#x27;s predictions, making it easier to explain the model&#x27;s behavior.

Would you like more details on how to set up the Model Interpretability component or any other aspect of the Responsible AI dashboard?</p></blockquote>
