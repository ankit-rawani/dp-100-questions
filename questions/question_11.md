# Question 11

This question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the recommendation satisfies the requirements.

You have been tasked with evaluating your model on a partial data sample via k-fold cross-validation.

You have already configured a k parameter as the number of splits. You now have to configure the k parameter for the cross-validation with the usual value choice.

Recommendation: You configure the use of the value k=10.

Will the requirements be satisfied?

- A.Yes
- B.No

<blockquote><p><strong>emmanuelodenyire</strong> <code>(Thu 26 Sep 2024 10:04)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>The answer is A. Yes, because k=10 is a common choice for the number of folds in k-fold cross-validation, and it can satisfy the requirement to evaluate the model on a partial data sample. However, the appropriate value for k may depend on the size of the dataset and the desired level of accuracy. In some cases, a value other than 10 might be more appropriate.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>CSLK</strong> <code>(Wed 25 Jan 2023 10:35)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>The usual value choice for the k parameter in k-fold cross-validation is 10. This value is commonly used because it provides a good balance between having a high number of folds (which results in a lower bias but a higher variance) and a low number of folds (which results in a higher bias but a lower variance)</p></blockquote>
