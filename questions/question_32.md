# Question 32

This question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the recommendation satisfies the requirements.

You have been tasked with constructing a machine learning model that translates language text into a different language text.

The machine learning model must be constructed and trained to learn the sequence of the.

Recommendation: You make use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for training text (words sequence) in term of seq2seq, but now it is out of date, use Transformer as alternative solution.

Anyway, CNN is incorrect for NLP.</p></blockquote>

&quot;CNNs are preferred in interpreting visual data, sparse data or data that does not come in sequence,&quot; [...] &quot;Recurrent neural networks, on the other hand, are designed to recognize sequential or temporal data. They do better predictions considering the order or sequence of the data as they relate to previous or the next data nodes.&quot;</p></blockquote>
