Indicates whether the step should reuse previous results when re-run with the same settings. Reuse is enabled by default. If the step contents (scripts/dependencies) as well as inputs and parameters remain unchanged, the output from the previous run of this step is reused. When reusing the step, instead of submitting the job to compute, the results from the previous run are immediately made available to any subsequent steps. If you use Azure Machine Learning datasets as inputs, reuse is determined by whether the dataset&#x27;s definition has changed, not by whether the underlying data has changed.
