# Question 274

You are building a recurrent neural network to perform a binary classification.

You review the training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, and validation accuracy for each training epoch.

You need to analyze model performance.

You need to identify whether the classification model is overfitted.

Which of the following is correct?

* A.The training loss stays constant and the validation loss stays on a constant value and close to the training loss value when training the model.
* B.The training loss decreases while the validation loss increases when training the model.
* C.The training loss stays constant and the validation loss decreases when training the model.
* D.The training loss increases while the validation loss decreases when training the model.

Train Accuracy is High (aka Less Loss), Test Accuracy is Low (aka High Loss)
Going by this, answer B is correct to me</p></blockquote>
