Categorical variable
Categorical variables contain a finite number of categories or distinct groups. Categorical data might not have a logical order. so here we have clear 2 distinct value for IsPlaySoccer and Gender.

Continuous variable
Continuous variables are numeric variables that have an infinite number of values between any two values. A continuous variable can be numeric or date/time. so here we have range of values for PrevExamMarks ,Height and Weight

Discrete variable
Discrete variables are numeric variables that have a countable number of values between any two values. A discrete variable is always numeric. For example, the number of customer complaints or the number of flaws or defects.</p></blockquote>
