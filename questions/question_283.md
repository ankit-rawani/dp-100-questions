# Question 283

DRAG DROP -

You previously deployed a model that was trained using a tabular dataset named training-dataset, which is based on a folder of CSV files.

Over time, you have collected the features and predicted labels generated by the model in a folder containing a CSV file for each month. You have created two tabular datasets based on the folder containing the inference data: one named predictions-dataset with a schema that matches the training data exactly, including the predicted label; and another named features-dataset with a schema containing all of the feature columns and a timestamp column based on the filename, which includes the day, month, and year.

You need to create a data drift monitor to identify any changing trends in the feature data since the model was trained. To accomplish this, you must define the required datasets for the data drift monitor.

Which datasets should you use to configure the data drift monitor? To answer, drag the appropriate datasets to the correct data drift monitor options. Each source may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

<blockquote><p><strong>David_Tadeu</strong> <code>(Fri 07 Apr 2023 10:44)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 18</em></p><p>The answer should be
Box 1. Training dataset
Box 2. Features dataset

because in data drift monitor,
Baseline dataset = &quot;usually the training dataset for a model&quot;.
Target dataset = &quot;... MUST have a timestamp column specified&quot;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Arend78</strong> <code>(Sat 16 Dec 2023 14:18)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>Indeed, the drift monitor looks at changes (e.g. seasonal) in the inputs, and does not look at the predictions</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>bobML</strong> <code>(Tue 10 Sep 2024 10:13)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>To configure a data drift monitor, you typically use a baseline dataset and a target dataset for comparison. In this scenario, you want to monitor the changing trends in the feature data since the model was trained. Here&#x27;s how you should configure the data drift monitor:

Baseline Dataset: Training-dataset

The baseline dataset should be the dataset that represents the data at the time when the model was trained. In this case, it&#x27;s the training-dataset since it is the original dataset used for training the model.
Target Dataset: Features-dataset

The target dataset should be the dataset that you want to monitor for data drift, which contains the features and timestamp information. In this case, it&#x27;s the features-dataset because it contains the feature data that you want to compare with the baseline data.
You don&#x27;t need to use the predictions-dataset for configuring the data drift monitor because it contains the predicted labels, which are not relevant for monitoring data drift in the features.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>pancman</strong> <code>(Tue 11 Apr 2023 19:52)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>J_AR you didn&#x27;t read the question correctly. The dataset that contains the timestamp is features-dataset.
