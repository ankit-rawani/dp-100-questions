# Question 397

You create an Azure Machine Learning workspace named ML-workspace. You also create an Azure Databricks workspace named DB-workspace. DB-workspace contains a cluster named DB-cluster.

You must use DB-cluster to run experiments from notebooks that you import into DB-workspace.

You need to use ML-workspace to track MLflow metrics and artifacts generated by experiments running on DB-cluster. The solution must minimize the need for custom code.

What should you do?
