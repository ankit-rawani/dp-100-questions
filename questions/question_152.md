Dataset2 -

![Question Image](../images/q152_q_image539.png)

You need to create a dataset that has the same columns and header row as the input datasets and contains all rows from both input datasets.

Solution: Use the Join Data module.

<blockquote><p><strong>avinyc</strong> <code>(Fri 03 Jan 2025 03:43)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>&quot;Join Data&quot; is for SQL type joins, &quot;Add Rows&quot; will be suitable in this case. Hence the solution does not meet the guideline.</p></blockquote>

I checked on the Designer module description.. 
Module: Join Data
Description: Joins two datasets on selected key columns.

we don&#x27;t need to select key columns and there is no matching rows. We only need to append data. So, Add Row module is right</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>sl_mslconsulting</strong> <code>(Sat 16 Nov 2024 02:35)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>It won&#x27;t work using the Join Data even you use Full Outer Join
For each of the rows in either table that have no matching rows in the other, the result includes a row containing missing values.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Plb2</strong> <code>(Sat 24 Aug 2024 16:44)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>whereas on Apply SQL transformation (one of the other questions) FULL OUTER JOIN is not supported;

<blockquote><p><strong>zishankamal</strong> <code>(Thu 15 Aug 2024 02:38)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>We use the Join Data component to merge two datasets using a database-style join operation. 
Full Outer Join: A full outer join returns all rows from the left table (table1) and from the right table (table2).

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/component-reference/join-data?view=azureml-api-2

&quot;Add Rows&quot; or &quot;Execute Python Script&quot; are also possible ways to do this.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>edogawa</strong> <code>(Wed 10 Apr 2024 09:04)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>It is the &#x27;Add Rows&#x27; component which does it.</p></blockquote>
