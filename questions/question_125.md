# Question 125

HOTSPOT

-

You train a model by using Azure Machine Learning. You use Azure Blob Storage to store production data.

The model must be re-trained when new data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. You need to minimize development and coding.

You need to configure Azure services to develop a re-training solution.

Which Azure services should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

<blockquote><p><strong>sanctafrax</strong> <code>(Fri 31 Jan 2025 14:44)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>Given answer seems correct. Event grid needs to be filled explicitly (by someone), it does not happen by itself. you need some kind of function. Therefore detecting whether or not there is new data can be done by a timed based triggered function which pushes an event to an event grid. Then trigger the retraining based on the event grid entry.</p></blockquote>

Event Grid: Used for reactive programming based on event-driven architectures, distributing event notifications.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>PI_Team</strong> <code>(Thu 25 Jan 2024 12:15)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 5</em></p><p>Identify when new data is uploaded: You can use Event Grid to subscribe to events that are emitted when new data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. Event Grid will send an event to your subscription whenever a new blob is created or modified.

Trigger re-training: Logic Apps can be a good choice for linking data to blob storage and then to ML Studio. Logic Apps are a more complex solution than Functions, but they offer more flexibility and integration capabilities.

I think Logic Apps would be a better choice over Functions for triggering as the question asks for linking different services together. As far as I know, Logic Apps can be used to integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Notification Hubs and Azure Service Bus and if we need to integrate with other Azure services, then Logic Apps may be a better choice.

In this problem it sound like simple process so I think Functions is better than Logic Apps.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>rishi_ram</strong> <code>(Tue 28 Nov 2023 10:47)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>Azure Event Grid: Azure Event Grid can be used to monitor events in Azure Blob Storage. You can configure Event Grid to trigger an event when new data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

    Azure Functions: Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that can be used to run your re-training code in response to the event triggered by Azure Event Grid. You can write your re-training logic as a function and configure it to be executed when the event is received.

By combining Azure Event Grid and Azure Functions, you can create an automated re-training pipeline that triggers the re-training process whenever new data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, without the need for extensive coding or manual intervention.</p></blockquote>

you can configure Azure Blob Storage to trigger an event in Azure Event Grid when new data is uploaded. Then, you can create an Azure Function that listens for the event and initiates the re-training process</p></blockquote>
