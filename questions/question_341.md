# Question 341

HOTSPOT

-

You use Azure Machine Learning to train a machine learning model.

You use the following training script in Python to perform logging:

import mlflow

mlflow.log_metric(â€œaccuracy", float(vel_accuracy))

You must use a Python script to define a sweep job.

You need to provide the primary metric and goal you want hyperparameter tuning to optimize.

How should you complete the Python script? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
