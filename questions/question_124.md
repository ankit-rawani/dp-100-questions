# Question 124

HOTSPOT

-

You train classification and regression models by using automated machine learning.

You must evaluate automated machine learning experiment results. The results include how a classification model is making systematic errors in its predictions and the relationship between the target feature and the regression modelâ€™s predictions. You must use charts generated by automated machine learning.

You need to choose a chart type for each model type.

Which chart types should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

1. Confusion Matrix 
2. Prediction vs True

The calibration curve plots a model&#x27;s confidence in its predictions against the proportion of positive samples at each confidence level (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml?view=azureml-api-2#calibration-curve)

The predicted vs. true chart plots the relationship between the target feature (true/actual values) and the model&#x27;s predictions (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml?view=azureml-api-2#predicted-vs-true)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>labriji</strong> <code>(Mon 23 Oct 2023 18:02)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 4</em></p><p>* for sure we use the &quot;confusion matrix&quot; for classification problem ðŸ˜„

* for regression, we dont use &quot;confusion matrix&quot;,  we use
&gt;&gt; &quot;Calibration curve&quot;: shows the relationship between the predicted values and the actual values.
&gt;&gt; &quot;Predicted vs. true&quot;: visual representation of the model&#x27;s performance.
i think both are correct ðŸ˜…</p></blockquote>
