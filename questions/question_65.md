# Question 65

You plan to provision an Azure Machine Learning Basic edition workspace for a data science project.

You need to identify the tasks you will be able to perform in the workspace.

Which three tasks will you be able to perform? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- A.Create a Compute Instance and use it to run code in Jupyter notebooks.
- B.Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) inference cluster.
- C.Use the designer to train a model by dragging and dropping pre-defined modules.
- D.Create a tabular dataset that supports versioning.
- E.Use the Automated Machine Learning user interface to train a model.

There are many more question on Studio(classic) that I have ignore hoping that similar question will get asked for designer instead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>NullVoider_0</strong> <code>(Wed 12 Jun 2024 10:23)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 12</em></p><p>As of December 2023, you can use 
A) Create a Compute Instance and use it to run code in Jupyter notebooks.
C) Use the designer to train a model by dragging and dropping pre-defined modules.
E) Use the Automated Machine Learning user interface to train a model.

Currently, Create AKS deployment clusters, and Create versioned tabular datasets are not supported in Azure ML studio. If you want to access these services then you will have to go to AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) for AKS-related stuff.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Saurabhjain507</strong> <code>(Sun 27 Nov 2022 07:02)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 1</em></p><p>Yes, this comment is correct. There is also data versioning available when you create datasets.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>chaudha4</strong> <code>(Wed 20 Oct 2021 21:56)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 10</em></p><p>This seems like an outdated question (as of April 2021). There is no mention of any basic or enterprise options. There is only one and based on what I see, you can do everything listed in the question.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>ACSC</strong> <code>(Thu 23 Sep 2021 17:33)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 8</em></p><p>Beginning December 21st, all Enterprise Edition workspaces will be automatically set to Basic Edition, which has the same capabilities. No downtime will occur during this process. On January 1, 2021, Enterprise Edition will be formally retired.
