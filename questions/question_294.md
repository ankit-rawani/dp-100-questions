# Question 294

DRAG DROP

-

You create an Azure Machine Learning workspace. You are training a classification model with no-code AutoML in Azure Machine Learning studio.

The model must predict if a client of a financial institution will subscribe to a fixed-term deposit. You must identify the feature that has the most influence on the predictions of the model for the second highest scoring algorithm. You must minimize the effort and time to identify the feature.

You need to complete the identification.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.
