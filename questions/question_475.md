<p>Box 1: Positive skew -</p>
<p>Positive skew values means the distribution is skewed to the right.</p>
<p>Box 2: Negative skew -</p>
<p>Negative skewness values mean the distribution is skewed to the left.</p>

A left-skewed distribution has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called negatively-skewed distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the peak.

A right-skewed distribution has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the positive direction on the number line. The mean is also to the right of the peak.

<blockquote><p><strong>NormanDS</strong> <code>(Sat 05 Nov 2022 10:44)</code> - <em>Upvotes: 2</em></p><p>The microsoft reference (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/compute-elementary-statistics) is technically correct.
&quot;Negative skew values means the distribution is skewed to the left. 0 denotes the normal distribution. Positive skewness values mean the distribution is skewed to the right.&quot;

This is validated by Wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#positive_skew):
negative skew: The left tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure. The distribution is said to be left-skewed, left-tailed, or skewed to the left,...
positive skew: The right tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the figure. The distribution is said to be right-skewed, right-tailed, or skewed to the right,...

Ergo, the answers are interchanged. G1: should be negative skew and G2: positive. See the figure from the wiki link or the link provided by VickyM.

At times like this, I am starting to doubt the competence of the answers provided.</p></blockquote>

The first one is negative and the second one is positive

Graph-2-&gt; positively skewed
