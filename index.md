A set of CSV files contains sales records. All the CSV files have the same data schema.

Each CSV file contains the sales record for a particular month and has the filename sales.csv. Each file is stored in a folder that indicates the month and year when the data was recorded. The folders are in an Azure blob container for which a datastore has been defined in an Azure Machine Learning workspace. The folders are organized in a parent folder named sales to create the following hierarchical structure:

![Question Image](images/q66_0007900001.png)

At the end of each month, a new folder with that month's sales file is added to the sales folder.

You plan to use the sales data to train a machine learning model based on the following requirements:

✑ You must define a dataset that loads all of the sales data to date into a structure that can be easily converted to a dataframe.

✑ You must be able to create experiments that use only data that was created before a specific previous month, ignoring any data that was added after that month.

✑ You must register the minimum number of datasets possible.

You need to register the sales data as a dataset in Azure Machine Learning service workspace.

What should you do?

* A.Create a tabular dataset that references the datastore and explicitly specifies each 'sales/mm-yyyy/sales.csv' file every month. Register the dataset with the name sales_dataset each month, replacing the existing dataset and specifying a tag named month indicating the month and year it was registered. Use this dataset for all experiments.
* B.Create a tabular dataset that references the datastore and specifies the path 'sales/*/sales.csv', register the dataset with the name sales_dataset and a tag named month indicating the month and year it was registered, and use this dataset for all experiments.
* C.Create a new tabular dataset that references the datastore and explicitly specifies each 'sales/mm-yyyy/sales.csv' file every month. Register the dataset with the name sales_dataset_MM-YYYY each month with appropriate MM and YYYY values for the month and year. Use the appropriate month-specific dataset for experiments.
* D.Create a tabular dataset that references the datastore and explicitly specifies each 'sales/mm-yyyy/sales.csv' file. Register the dataset with the name sales_dataset each month as a new version and with a tag named month indicating the month and year it was registered. Use this dataset for all experiments, identifying the version to be used based on the month tag as necessary.

![Question Image](images/q289_0031800001.png)

The experiment must record the unique labels in the data as metrics for the run that can be reviewed later.

You must add code to the script to record the unique label values as run metrics at the point indicated by the comment.

Solution: Replace the comment with the following code:

run.log_list('Label Values', label_vals)

Does the solution meet the goal?

## Question 393 | [Link](https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/36440-exam-dp-100-topic-4-question-22-discussion/){:target="_blank"}

You use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to run a training experiment that trains a classification model and calculates its accuracy metric.

The model will be retrained each month as new data is available.

You must register the model for use in a batch inference pipeline.

You need to register the model and ensure that the models created by subsequent retraining experiments are registered only if their accuracy is higher than the currently registered model.

What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

* A.Specify a different name for the model each time you register it.
* B.Register the model with the same name each time regardless of accuracy, and always use the latest version of the model in the batch inferencing pipeline.
* C.Specify the model framework version when registering the model, and only register subsequent models if this value is higher.
* D.Specify a property named accuracy with the accuracy metric as a value when registering the model, and only register subsequent models if their accuracy is  higher than the accuracy property value of the currently registered model.
* E.Specify a tag named accuracy with the accuracy metric as a value when registering the model, and only register subsequent models if their accuracy is higher than the accuracy tag value of the currently registered model.

HOTSPOT

-

You have a binary classifier that predicts positive cases of diabetes within two separate age groups.

The classifier exhibits a high degree of disparity between the age groups.

You need to modify the output of the classifier to maximize its degree of fairness across the age groups and meet the following requirements:

•	Eliminate the need to retrain the model on which the classifier is based.

•	Minimize the disparity between true positive rates and false positive rates across age groups.

Which algorithm and parity constraint should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
