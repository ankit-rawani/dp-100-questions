## Question 66

A set of CSV files contains sales records. All the CSV files have the same data schema.

Each CSV file contains the sales record for a particular month and has the filename sales.csv. Each file is stored in a folder that indicates the month and year when the data was recorded. The folders are in an Azure blob container for which a datastore has been defined in an Azure Machine Learning workspace. The folders are organized in a parent folder named sales to create the following hierarchical structure:

![Question Image](images/q66_0007900001.png)

At the end of each month, a new folder with that month's sales file is added to the sales folder.

You plan to use the sales data to train a machine learning model based on the following requirements:

✑ You must define a dataset that loads all of the sales data to date into a structure that can be easily converted to a dataframe.

✑ You must be able to create experiments that use only data that was created before a specific previous month, ignoring any data that was added after that month.

✑ You must register the minimum number of datasets possible.

You need to register the sales data as a dataset in Azure Machine Learning service workspace.

## Question 284

DRAG DROP -

You previously deployed a model that was trained using a tabular dataset named training-dataset, which is based on a folder of CSV files.

Over time, you have collected the features and predicted labels generated by the model in a folder containing a CSV file for each month. You have created two tabular datasets based on the folder containing the inference data: one named predictions-dataset with a schema that matches the training data exactly, including the predicted label; and another named features-dataset with a schema containing all of the feature columns and a timestamp column based on the filename, which includes the day, month, and year.

You need to create a data drift monitor to identify any changing trends in the feature data since the model was trained. To accomplish this, you must define the required datasets for the data drift monitor.

Which datasets should you use to configure the data drift monitor? To answer, drag the appropriate datasets to the correct data drift monitor options. Each source may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
